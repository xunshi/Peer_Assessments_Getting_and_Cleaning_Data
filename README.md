Unzip the data to the working directory.

The R script called run_analysis.R does the following. 

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- From the data set in last step, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
